As per the Zlib license used by this project, here are the changes
that I've applied, in order of importance/relevance:

* Added “ORLP_” prefix to declspec macro (to prevent possible collisions with other libraries making use of the same name).
* Added CMakeLists.txt and build.sh for easy packaging and inclusion into other projects.
* Added fix from orlp/ed25519 pull request #15: https://github.com/orlp/ed25519/pull/15
* Deleted .dll files inside repo.
* Adapted readme.md accordingly.
* Implemented C# wrapper class.
* Added this CHANGELOG file.
